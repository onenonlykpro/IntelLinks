# Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)
## by Richards (Dick) J. Heuer, Jr.

Making judgement on an issue that involves a high risk of error in reasoning?  Richards (Dick) J. Heuer, Jr.'s Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) might be useful to you.  This method consists of the following steps:
1. Identify all potential hypotheses (this will discourage you from choosing one hyptohesis that you beleive is likely and using evidence to confirm it).
2. List evidence and/or findings that are relevant to any of the hypotheses.
3. Evaluate each peice of evidence and/or findings against each hypothesis and aim to disprove as many of them as possible.
4. Review evidence and hypotheses to determine if you need to find more evidence to disprove any of the hypotheses.
5. Consider how your estimate would be affected if evidence and/or findings were wrong or incorrectly interpreted.
