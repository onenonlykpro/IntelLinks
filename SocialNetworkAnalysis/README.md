# Social Network Analysis

Social network analysis is the process of investigating organizations or other social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It can help produce interesting insights into the entities and people within the organization or social structure by analyzing the ties, edges, or links that connect them.  There a only a few steps you must do to perform a simple social network analysis.

1. In a spreadsheet, create a list of ties (i.e. edges or links) of the organization or social structure you wish to analyze.  You may download a template from [INSERT LINK TO SNA TEMPLATE].  If you only want a demo of this tool, you can download and use a dataset of Game of Thrones families produced by Shirin Glander (support her by starring her repository at https://github.com/ShirinG).

2. Upload your .csv file.
