# Event and Timeline Analysis

Event and timeline (E&T) analysis displays events sequentially in a visual manner. Successful application of this  technique can uncover important trends about a firmâ€™s competitive strategy, an adversary's M.O., and serve as an early-warning  system by highlighting when an external force takes an action that is unique from its usual or expected behavior.  This method  is also useful for scenarios in which there are a series of complicated events, which can overwhelm and analyst or decision maker.
