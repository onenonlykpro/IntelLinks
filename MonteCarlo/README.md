# Simple Monte Carlo
## by Douglas Hubbard

Douglas Hubbard's very simple but incredibly useful Monte Carlo needs three parameters: the maximum, the minimum, and the average of the observations you currently have.  This tool will also calculate risk based on you risk boundary (the point at an outcome can be determined a loss).  The simulation results will update as you submit new parameters.
